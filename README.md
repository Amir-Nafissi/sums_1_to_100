# sums_1_to_100

## Discription

This is a program that finds ways to write each natural number from 1 to 100 using a sum of consecutive natural numbers. For example, 9 = 2 + 3 + 4.

It prints each sum in a file called *sums.txt*. If there is more than one way, it will use the one with the most addends (e.g. 15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 instead of 15 = 7 + 8). If the sum is not possible, it writes that it is not possible (e.g. "16 is NOT possible.")
